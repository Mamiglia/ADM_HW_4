The purpose of this repository is to answer the assigned questions in the [Homework#4](https://github.com/lucamaiano/ADM/tree/master/2022/Homework_4) of the Algorithms for Data Mining course, 2022.

The data analysis is performed on a [banking dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/bank-customer-segmentation) from Kaggle. The repository consists of the following files:

1. `main.ipynb`: a Jupyter Notebook that answers all the aforementioned questions, Research, Algorithmic, Command Line, Bonus, and can be viewed [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/Mamiglia/ADM_HW_4/blob/main/main.ipynb).
2. `functions` folder: a folder containing all the classes and functions used in the notebook, divided in:
  - `minhash.py`: functions for the minhashing of Q1.
  - `clustering.py`: functions and algorithms for clustering and clustering evaluation of Q2.
  - `utils.py`: some other utility functions.
3. `commandline.sh`: a file that provides the answer to the Commmand Line question.
